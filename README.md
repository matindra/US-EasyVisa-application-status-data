# US-EasyVisa-application-status-data
The dataset contains data on US Visa applications for foreign employees

## Problem statement.

* United States Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) gives job certification applications for employers seeking to bring foreign workers into the United States and grants certifications. 
* As In last year the count of employees were huge so OFLC needs Machine learning models to shortlist visa applicants based on their previous data.

**In this project we are going to use the data given to build a Classification model:**

* This model is to check if Visa get approved or denied based on the given dataset.
* This can be used to recommend a suitable profile for the applicants for whom the visa should be certified or denied based on the certain criteria which influences the decision.
